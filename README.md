# CS2011-Data-Structures-Algorithms
This repository contains coursework for the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course (CS20111) offered in the Fall 2022 semester at Effat University.

# Course Overview
This course covers the design, implementation, and analysis of fundamental data structures and algorithms. 
<br>Topics include:

<br>Binary search
<br>Linked lists (singly linked and doubly linked)
<br>Binary trees
<br>AVL trees
<br>Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort)
<br>Graphs (representation, traversal, shortest path algorithms)
# Contents
The repository contains the following files and directories:
