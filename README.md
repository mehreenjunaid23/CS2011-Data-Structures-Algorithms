# CS2011-Data-Structures-Algorithms
This repository contains coursework for the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course (CS20111) offered in the Fall 2022 semester at Effat University.

# Course Overview
This course covers the design, implementation, and analysis of fundamental data structures and algorithms. 
<br>Topics include:

Binary search
Linked lists (singly linked and doubly linked)
Binary trees
AVL trees
Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort)
Graphs (representation, traversal, shortest path algorithms)
# Contents
The repository contains the following files and directories:

<br>binary_search/: An implementation of binary search algorithm.
<br>binaryTree/: An implementation of a binary tree data structure.
<br>bubble_sort/: An implementation of bubble sort algorithm.
<br>doubly_linked_list/: An implementation of a doubly linked list data structure.
<br>graphs/: An implementation of graph data structure and some graph algorithms.
<br>lect3/: Lecture notes and examples on linked lists and binary trees.
<br>lecture2/: Lecture notes and examples on algorithms and analysis.
<br>linked_list/: An implementation of a singly linked list data structure.
<br>selection_sort/: An implementation of selection sort algorithm.
Each file or directory contains the source code and documentation for the corresponding data structure or algorithm.
